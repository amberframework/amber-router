2018-06-18  v0.1.0 - Update for Crystal 0.25.0

Bugfix
	* Includes workaround for delegation bug in Crystal 0.25.0


2018-03-02  v0.0.3 - Initial stable release

Features
	* Parameterized Segments
	  - parameterized segments start with a `:`
	  - bugfix from radix: named parameters at the same nesting level can
	    have different names

	* Glob Segments
	  - glob segments will match any part of a URL and start with a `*`
	  - bugfix from radix: globs don't _need_ to swallow the entire url,
	    but can be placed in the middle of a url, eg: /path/*/path/

	* When multiple routes are matched, they're sorted by insertion order
	  and the first is returned.
